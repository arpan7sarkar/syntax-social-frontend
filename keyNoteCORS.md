Always remeber while conneting to backend with the frontend you will need to be use cors just install it and app.use cors()
 then after that you have to pass some config to cors such as origin: link of frontend website and credintials:true 
for accesing the cookie session into the front end now one last thing into the front end side while calling the api using 
axios just write in the last part withCreditianls:true now all set
